## What is Kubectl?

**Kubectl** is a command line tool that enables administrators to interact with [Kubernetes](../../kubernetes/what-is-kubernetes) 
[clusters](../../kubernetes/clusters) — whether deployed locally or in the cloud — to perform tasks such 
as deploying applications, inspecting cluster resources, viewing logs, scaling workloads, and debugging running 
containers.
