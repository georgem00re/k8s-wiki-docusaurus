# Ephemerality

## What is Ephemerality?

**Ephemerality** is the quality of lasting for a short time.
In computing, an ephemeral resource is one that is temporary, short-lived, and designed to be automatically discarded or 
destroyed after a limited period of use.

## Example

A Docker container running a single batch job is an ephemeral resource: 
it exists just long enough to complete the task and is then removed, leaving no trace.
