# Control Plane

A Kubernetes cluster has one or more control plane nodes.
A cluster can run with just one control plane node, but typically has multiple for redundancy and availability.
The collective set of control plane nodes (and the processes running on them) is known as the cluster's control plane.
The control plane is considered the 'brain' of the Kubernetes cluster.
