# Objects

## What is an Object?

In [Kubernetes](what-is-kubernetes), an **object** is a persistent entity that represents a 'piece' of your 
[containerised application's](../terminology/containerised-application) desired state.
Objects tell Kubernetes what you want to exist in your [cluster](clusters) â€” for example, which 
applications to run, which container images to use, how many replicas to maintain, and how those workloads should be 
exposed or stored.
You can think of an object as a single building block for a containerised workload running on a Kubernetes cluster.
