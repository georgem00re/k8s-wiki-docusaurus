# Worker Nodes

## What is a Worker Node?

A [Kubernetes](what-is-kubernetes) [cluster](clusters) has zero or more worker [nodes](nodes).
**Worker nodes** host containerised workloads.
To host and run a [containerised application](../concepts/containerised-application), a cluster must have at least 
one worker node.
