# Declarative Configuration

## Kubernetes is Declarative

[Kubernetes](what-is-kubernetes) is **declarative**, which means that you define the desired state of your 
[containerised application](../concepts/containerised-application) — such as which containers should be running, how 
many replicas they should have, and how they should be exposed — and Kubernetes continuously works to ensure the actual 
state of your application matches that desired state.
The desired state of your application is defined using a series of YAML manifest files.
