## Container Orchestration

**Kubernetes**, also known as **K8s**, is an open-source [container orchestration](../concepts/container-orchestration) platform.

It is used to deploy, manage, and scale [containerised applications](../concepts/containerised-application).

## Clusters

Kubernetes runs containerised applications on clusters.

A cluster is a collection of nodes that coordinate and worth together as a single unified system.

## Nodes

A node is a physical or virtual machine that runs various Kubernetes agent processes.

The nodes of a cluster are not necessarily colocated. This makes a Kubernetes cluster a distributed system.
