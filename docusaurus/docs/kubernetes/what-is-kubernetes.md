# Introduction to Kubernetes

## What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes**, also known as **K8s**, is an open-source 
[container orchestration](../terminology/container-orchestration) platform.
Kubernetes is primarily used to deploy, manage, and scale [containerised applications](../terminology/containerised-application).
The Kubernetes project was originally created by Google, but is now maintained by a worldwide community of contributors.
