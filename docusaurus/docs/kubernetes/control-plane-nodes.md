# Control Plane Nodes

## What is a Control Plane Node?

A [Kubernetes](what-is-kubernetes) [cluster](clusters) has one or more control plane [nodes](nodes).
**Control plane nodes** are responsible for managing the overall state and operation of the cluster.
A cluster can run with just a single control plane node, but typically has multiple for redundancy and availability.
