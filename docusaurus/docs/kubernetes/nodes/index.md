## What is a Node?

[Kubernetes](../what-is-kubernetes) [clusters](../clusters) are composed of nodes. 
A **node** is a physical or virtual machine that runs various Kubernetes agent processes that enable it to communicate 
and operate as part of a cluster. 
The nodes within a Kubernetes cluster are not necessarily colocated, which makes the cluster a
[distributed system](../../concepts/distributed-system).

## Node Types

A Kubernetes cluster is composed of two main node types:
- [Control Plane Nodes](../control-plane-nodes)
- [Worker Nodes](../worker-nodes)
